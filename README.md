## Overview

This repository showcases a full-stack web application built with the **MERN** stack, which includes:
- **MongoDB**: For database management.
- **Express.js**: As the server-side framework.
- **React.js**: For building a responsive and dynamic front-end.
- **Node.js**: For backend runtime.

## Features
- User authentication and authorization.
- CRUD operations for [your key entities, e.g., posts, users].
- Responsive design with React.
- RESTful APIs for seamless client-server communication.
- Scalable and maintainable project structure.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
- MongoDB installed locally or an active MongoDB Atlas cluster.
